## Getting Started
This section will show you how to create your own copy of this template and link it to your Shopify store so you can start building immediately.

### Prerequisites 
This guide is editor agnostic, although [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended. You should also have the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/install) installed for convenience. Furthermore you should also have Git installed and posses some [basic Git skills](https://www.atlassian.com/git), as well as knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Liquid.

### Step by step guide
 1. **[Create a copy](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)** of the template repository
